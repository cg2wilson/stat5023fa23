            <title>Three-Way Factorial Experiment</title>

            <p>
                A two-way factorial design looks at all combinations of two factors A and B; we can extend to three factors. Consider an experiment with three treatments: A with <m>a</m> levels, B with <m>b</m> levels, and C with <m>c</m> levels. This gives a <m>a\times b\times c</m> factorial structure with <m>abc</m> treatment combinations.

                We have the notation <m>Y_{ijkl}</m> to notate the <m>l</m>th replicates with treatments <m>A=i,B=j,C=k</m>:

            <p>
                A two-way interaction can be interpreted in the same manner as before. The presence of an AC interaction means that the mean responses among the levels of factor A are different across the levels of factor C.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to interpret a three-way interaction, we need to consider that the differences in mean responses for levels of factor C change across combinations of levels for factors A and B. The pattern in the interactions between factors A and B changes across the levels of factor C.
            </p>
            <p>
                Under the presence of a three-way interaction, we plot a separate profile plot for the two-way interaction at each level of the other factor to check different patterns in several of the profile plots. If the three-way interaction is significant, then comparisons among each treatment combination of A, B, and C must be made for main effects. If the three-way interaction is not significant, but at least one of the two-way interactions is, then comparisons among the involved treatment combinations must be made for main effects. If both two-way and three-way interactions are insignificant, then the output from the ANOVA table can be directly interpreted for main effects.
