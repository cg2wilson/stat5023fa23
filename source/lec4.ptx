                            Such variability would also exist among units across different treatment levels

                            <term>Replication</term>: an independent observation at a treatment level. When each treatment level is applied to several experimental units, we have more than a single replication

                        <p>
                            Having more replications would be helpful to measure experimental error and eventually leads to more precise inference

        <title>Completely Randomized Design (CRD)</title>

        <p>
            We are interested in the effect of factor/treatment on response.
        </p>
        <p>
            <term>Completely Randomized Design (CRD)</term>: independent and completely random assignments of treatments to experimental units
        </p>
        <p>
            In CRD, each experimental unit has the same probability of having each treatment
        </p>
        <p>
            ANOVA works under these assumptions: random and independent samples
        </p>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Suppose we study the effect of three different fertilizers on corn yields with 15 1-acre plots. Each fertilizer is assigned to 5 randomly selected plots.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to a gradient in the 15-acre field affecting yields, fertilizers are randomly assigned to 1-acre plots within strips in the field.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    The original setup is a CRD, as all units are homogeneous. However, due to the gradient, our response (which is crop yields) would be affected by both fertilizers and the gradient.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The solution is to randomly assign, within a 3x5 grid, treatments to a cell in a column. However, when we specificaly assign a treatments to 3x1 strips, we break the CRD designation because the equal probability condition will be broken.

        <title>Linear Model Approach</title>

        <p>
            This is a description of a CRD experiment based on a statistical model.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have
            <me>
                Y_{ij} = \mu_i + \varepsilon_{ij}
            </me>
            where <m>Y_{ij}</m> is the <m>j-</m>th observation of the treatment level <m>i</m>, <m>\mu_i</m> is the treatment level <m>i</m>, and <m>\varepsilon_{ij}</m> denotes the random error associated with unit <m>j</m> in treatment level <m>i</m> such that
            <me>
                \varepsilon_{ij} \approx_{iid} N(0,\sigma^2)
            </me>
            This model is also referred to as a "mean model"
        </p>
        <p>
            <m>\mu_i</m> is an unknown, fixed (and thus, non-random) parameter
        </p>
        <p>
            The assumption on <m>\varepsilon_{ij}</m> in the statement of <m>Y_{ij}</m> above is equivalent to the one-way ANOVA assumptions: <m>t</m> independent, random samples, and that there are <m>t</m> normal popualations with equal variances
        </p>

        <p>
            An alternative way of writing
            <me>
                Y_{ij} = \mu_i + \varepsilon_{ij}
            </me>
            is referred to as an "effects model" such that
            <me>
                Y_{ij} = \mu + \tau_i + \varepsilon_{ij}
            </me>
            where <m>\mu</m> is the overall mean and <m>\tau_i</m> is the <m>i-</m>th treatment level effect.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this case, <m>\mu</m> and <m>\tau_i</m> are unknown, fixed (and thus, non random) parameters
        </p>
        <p>
            We have a handful of comparisons:

        <p>
            For hypothesis testing:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The means model takes the hypotheses <m>H_0: \mu_i = \mu_j</m> for all <m>i,j\in \lrbrace{1,...,t}</m> vs. the alternative that <m>\mu_i \neq \mu_j</m> for some at least one pair <m>i,j</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The effects model takes the hypotheses <m>H_0: \tau_i = \tau_j = 0</m> for all <m>i,j\in\lrbrace{1,...,t}</m> vs. the alternative that at least one <m>\tau_i</m> is non-zero
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            The effects model also has different point estimates:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>\mu = \hat{\mu} = \overline{Y}_{\cdot\cdot}</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>\tau_i = \hat{\tau_i} = \overline{Y}_{i\cdot} - \overline{Y}_{\cdot\cdot}</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            We may also note that we have a similar statement to the TSS decomposition in ANOVA:
            <me>
                Y_{ij} = \overline{Y}_{\cdot\cdot} + (\overline{Y}_{i\cdot}-\overline{Y}_{\cdot\cdot}) + (Y_{ij} - \overline{Y}_{i\cdot})
            </me>
            where
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>\overline{Y}_{\cdot\cdot} = \hat{\mu}</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>\overline{Y}_{i\cdot}-\overline{Y}_{\cdot\cdot} = \hat{\tau_i}</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>Y_{ij} - \overline{Y}_{i\cdot} = \hat{\varepsilon_{ij}}</m>
                    </p>
