            <title>Experiments with Repeated Measures</title>

            <p>
                An <term>experiment with repeated measures</term> is one in which each experimental unit has more than a single measurement taken over time or location. For example, if patients are randomly assigned to one of two medications, they may have a response measured every week for three weeks. Comparison of medications, weeks on medications, and the interaction between the two can be investigated. Let <m>Y_{ijk}</m> denote an observation at time <m>j</m> on experimental unit <m>k</m> of treatment level <m>i</m>.

            <p>
                So far, we have assumed observations are independent. However, in a repeated measures setup, <m>Y_{ijk}</m> and <m>Y_{ij'k}</m> are likely to be correlated; in order to appropriately analyze the repeated measures, we need to account for how the observations within each subject are dependent to each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                The solution is to use <term>covariance</term> (a numerical measure of linear association between two random variables). Covariance generalizes variance to multiple variables. A small covariance indicates no linear association between two random variables, while a larger one indicates a stronger association. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the medication example above, the measurements are made on the same unit for three weeks. So, we need to consider the covariance structure between Week 1 and Week 2, Week 1 and Week 3, and Week 2 and Week 3.
            </p>
            <p>
                The structure of covariance for the model must be chosen specifically. We have four options; let <m>0\lt \rho \lt 1</m>:

                            VC is also referred to as "independence"; specifically, this means that there is no linear relationship between different random variables

                Choosing an appropriate structure is challenging and beyond the scope of the course; <c>SAS</c> provides some measures of model fit such as AIC, BIC. The Null Model Likelihood Ratio Test compares VC to the other specified one by testing the hypothesis
                <me>
                    H_0: \text{VC is appropriate }

                versus

                    H_a: \text{the other is appropriate}
                </me>
                The outputs can guide us to choose the covariance structure.

            <example>

                    <p>
                        An experiment is conducted to determine the effect of salt in the soil on the emergence of grass seeds. There are three replications of four plots, each treated to contain 0, 8, 16, and 24% salt. The percent of seeds emerging is observed 5, 8, 11, and 14 days after planting. THere are 12 separate plots; that is, the three replications within each level of salt are unrelated. Within each plot, there are four repeated measurements corresponding to days after planting.

                    <p>
                        The repeated measures can be analyzed using the following SAS code:

                        The line <c>SUBJECT = expunit(trt)</c> shows that each experimental unit is nested within treatment. The <c>TYPE = &lt; option ></c> specifies covariance structure.

                    <p>
                        Based on the SAS output (salt_output(1).pdf), we see the following (for VC):
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    The "Estimated R Matrix" identifies the relationship between the four time roles; this indicates that <m>\sigma^2 = 56.5212</m>; this is confirmed in the "Covariance Parameter Estimates" table.
                                </p>
                            </li>

                                <p>
                                    The AIC and BIC are going to be compared between different structures to determine the best.
                                </p>

                                    So since this is VC vs. VC, this table contributes nothing.

                                    The Fixed Effects table indicates that there is significant interaction, so we proceed normally.

                        For AR(1), we have
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    In the "Covariance Parameter Estimates" table, the AR(1) line indicates <m>\hat{\rho}</m>, and the Residual indicates <m>\hat{\sigma}^2</m>. In particular, we see that <m>\hat{\rho}\cdot \hat{\sigma}^2 = 0.83\cdot 52.7691 = 43.7987</m>. Similarly, <m>\hat{\rho}^2\sigma^2 = (0.83)^2\cdot 55.7691=36.3533</m>
                                </p>

                                    Comparing the AIC and BIC values with those from VC (215.6 vs. 245.4 and 216.6 vs. 245.9), since we go with smaller values, this suggests that AR(1) is more appropriate.

                                <p>
                                    The NMLR test concludes that <m>p \lt 0.0001</m>, so between the AIC/BIC measurements and the NMLR test, we choose AR(1) as the appropriate structure.

                        For CS, we have
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Since CS assumes covariance is the same, we see this in the R Matrix and the Parameter Estimates tables. Similarly, we see that <m>Cov(X,Y) + \sigma^2 = Cov(X,X) </m>. 
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>

                                    We see that AR(1) has smaller AIC and BIC values than CS, so we prefer AR(1) to CS, and both over VC.

                                    NMLR concludes that CS is more appropriate than VC.
