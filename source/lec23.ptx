            <title>Experiments with Repeated Measures</title>

            <p>
                An <term>experiment with repeated measures</term> is one in which each experimental unit has more than a single measurement taken over time or location. For example, if patients are randomly assigned to one of two medications, they may have a response measured every week for three weeks. Comparison of medications, weeks on medications, and the interaction between the two can be investigated. Let <m>Y_{ijk}</m> denote an observation at time <m>j</m> on experimental unit <m>k</m> of treatment level <m>i</m>.

                So far, we have assumed observations are independent. However, in a repeated measures setup, <m>Y_{ijk}</m> and <m>Y_{ij'k}</m> are likely to be correlated; in order to appropriately analyze the repeated measures, we need to account for how the observations within each subject are dependent to each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                The solution is to use <term>covariance</term> (a numerical measure of linear association between two random variables). Covariance generalizes variance to multiple variables. A small covariance indicates no linear association between two random variables, while a larger one indicates a stronger association. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the medication example above, the measurements are made on the same unit for three weeks. So, we need to consider the covariance structure between Week 1 and Week 2, Week 1 and Week 3, and Week 2 and Week 3.

                The structure of covariance for the model must be chosen specifically. We have four options; let <m>0\lt \rho \lt 1</m>:

                Choosing an appropriate structure is challenging and beyond the scope of the course; <c>SAS</c> provides some measures of model fit such as AIC, BIC. The Null Model Likelihood Ratio Test compares VC to the other specified one by testing the hypothesis
                <me>
                    H_0: \text{VC is appropriate }
                </me>
                versus
                <me>
                    H_a: \text{the other is appropriate}
                </me>
                The outputs can guide us to choose the covariance structure.
