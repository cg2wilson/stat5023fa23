<div class="para">Under the presence of a three-way interaction, we plot a separate profile plot for the two-way interaction at each level of the other factor to check different patterns in several of the profile plots. If the three-way interaction is significant, then comparisons among each treatment combination of A, B, and C must be made for main effects. If the three-way interaction is not significant, but at least one of the two-way interactions is, then comparisons among the involved treatment combinations must be made for main effects. If both two-way and three-way interactions are insignificant, then the output from the ANOVA table can be directly interpreted for main effects.</div>
