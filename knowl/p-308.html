<div class="para">This means that our goal becomes to identify factors that are sources of variability in the response variable instead of estimating some fixed effects. For example, we can consider what happens when the quality control engineer attempts to determine which factors in the production process are the major sources of variability (worker ability, types of machines, etc.). Rather than treating those factors as fixed, we can consider them as random. So, we need to estimate the contribution of each of these soruces of variability (called <dfn class="terminology">variance components</dfn>, see below) to the overall variability in the productâ€™s quality (response).</div>
