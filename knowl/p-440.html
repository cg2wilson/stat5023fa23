<div class="para">A study was designed to determine if additional phosphorus applied to the soil would increase the yield of soybeans. There are three major varieties of soybeans of interest (V1, V2, and V3) and four levels of phosphorus (0, 30, 60, and 90 pounds per acre). Researchers have nine plots of land available for the study. Because of the complexities of planting the soybeans on the plots of the given size, it was decided to plant a single variety of soybeans on each plot and then divide each plot into four subplots. Researchers randomly assigned a variety to one plot within each block of three plots and then randomy assigned the levels of phosphorus to the four subplots within each plot.</div>
