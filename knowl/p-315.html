<div class="para">A company wants to evalute the effectiveness of two different sunscreen types (<span class="process-math">\(S1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(S2\)</span>) with 40 subjects. For each subject, a 1-inch square was marked off on their back, under the shoulder and above the small of the back. A response is recorded based on reading the color of the skin in the square before and after the application of a fixed amount of each sunscreen. The measurement of color is extremely variable, so the company randomly selects 10 technicians from their worldwide staff to participate in the study to assess the variability in the readings due to the technician taking the readings. Four subjects, two having <span class="process-math">\(S1\)</span> and two having <span class="process-math">\(S2\text{,}\)</span> were randomly assigned to each technician for evaluation.</div>
