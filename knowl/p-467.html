<div class="para">An experiment is conducted to determine the effect of salt in the soil on the emergence of grass seeds. There are three replications of four plots, each treated to contain 0, 8, 16, and 24% salt. The percent of seeds emerging is observed 5, 8, 11, and 14 days after planting. THere are 12 separate plots; that is, the three replications within each level of salt are unrelated. Within each plot, there are four repeated measurements corresponding to days after planting.</div>
