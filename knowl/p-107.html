<div class="para">Researched conducted a study of biological agents to assess their effectiveness in comparison to the chemical weed agents. The study consisted of a control (no agent), two biological agents (Bio1 and Bio2) and two chemical agents (Chm1 and Chm2). Thirty 1-acre plots of land were planted with hay. Six plots were randomly assigned to receive one of the five treatments. The hay was harvested, and the total yield in tons per acre was recorded for each plot.</div>
