<div class="para">Up to now, weâ€™ve looked at a study or experiment involving factors having a predetermined set of levels. For a fixed effects model, the inferences are only for the levels of the factors actually used in the experiment; consider the example where we want to compare the intensities of the electrostatic discharges of lightning at three different tracking stations within a 20-mile radius of the central computing facilities of a university. Suppose that we want to make an inference for all possible tracking stations. Instead of being concerned about only these three tracking stations, we can consider these stations as a random sample of three taken from the many possible locations for tracking stations.</div>
